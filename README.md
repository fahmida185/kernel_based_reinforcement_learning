#Function Approximation in Reinforcement Learning
This report a on the use of function approixmation in Reinforcement Learning. In this report, we will implement the method of Kernel Based Reinforcement Learning (kbrl) as explained in [Ormoneit and Sen (2002)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1017928328829) using a nearest neighbor measure where the neighbors are weighted via a Gaussian Kernel. The ipython notebook in this repository assumes the reader has already read [Ormoneit and Sen (2002)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1017928328829) and is familiar with the concept that are introduced in this paper.
